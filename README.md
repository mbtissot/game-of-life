# Conway's Game of Life

My attempt at making [Conway's game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It ended up better than i expected, even though i know that it need to be optimized. However, it was a cool afternoon project, and i don't think i will come back to it.

I'd like to add a few 'standard' configurations to the code, so that the user can run, for example:
`python3 gol.py glider`
and the starting configuration would be the [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#/media/File:Game_of_life_animated_glider.gif). 

At this moment, the configuration that is hardcoded, is the 'podium' tetris piece, which looks like a little explosion.
